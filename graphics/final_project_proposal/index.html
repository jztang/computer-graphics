        <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>

        <p class="text">
        My final project is going to build off of ray tracing to half spaces, specifically to cubes. I will be creating<br>
        a Rubik's Cube, including color. My cube will consist of 27 smaller cubes. Just like a real Rubik's Cube,<br>
        the faces on my cube will spin (in groups of 9 smaller cubes).
        <p>

        <p class="text">
        I want the cube to be interactive via mouse, but I am not sure if I will have the time to implement that.<br>
        At a minimum, the cube will animate and solve itself.
