        <h2>Final Project - Rubik's Cube</h2>

        <p class="text">
        The goal of my final project was to create a working Rubik's Cube using ray tracing to half spaces. My<br>
        implementation involves 27 cube half spaces, each representing a part of a standard 3x3 Rubik's Cube.<br><br>

        Each "small" cube is labeled 1-27. Cubes 1-9 are the back layer, cubes 10-18 are the middle layer, and<br>
        cubes 19-27 are the front layer. I wasn't sure how to make "timed" animations such that the cube<br>
        appeared to solve itself, or how to make different faces of the same ray traced cube have different<br>
        colors. So I just have the faces rotating constantly, and cube half spaces in one color.<br><br>

        When I tried to render the cube, my PC's CPU usage shot up to 100%. I guess ray tracing to 27 different<br>
        half spaces is very resource intensive. I have the Rubik's Cube rotating, but the animation is very choppy<br>
        because of the high CPU usage. So click the examples below at your own risk, as your computer will<br>
        probably slow down a lot when it runs.<br>
